/*
You're working with an intern that keeps coming to you with 
JavaScript code that won't run because the braces, brackets, 
and parentheses are off. To save you both some time, you 
decide to write a braces/brackets/parentheses validator.

Let's say:

'(', '{', '[' are called "openers."
')', '}', ']' are called "closers."
Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an 
input string's openers and closers are properly nested.

Examples:

"{ [ ] ( ) }" should return true
"{ [ ( ] ) }" should return false
"{ [ }" should return false
*/


/*
We iterate through our string, making sure that:

each closer corresponds to the most recently seen, unclosed opener
every opener and closer is in a pair
We use a stack â†´ to keep track of the most recently seen, unclosed opener. 
And if the stack is ever empty when we come to a closer, we know that closer
doesn't have an opener.

So as we iterate:

If we see an opener, we push it onto the stack.
If we see a closer, we check to see if it is the closer for the opener 
at the top of the stack. If it is, we pop from the stack. If it isn't, or 
if the stack is empty, we return false.
If we finish iterating and our stack is empty, we know every opener was 
properly closed.

O(n) time (one iteration through the string), and O(n)O(n) space (in the 
worst case, all of our characters are openers, so we push them all onto 
the stack).

        '(': ')',

    const closers = new Set([')', '}', ']']);

    const myStack = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < code.length; i++) {
        const char = code.charAt(i);

            // seen unclosed opener, short-circuit, returning false
